Roll-Ball-Roll
==============

Make that ball roll! An Android app I made for my third year university project. Link to app coming soon!

The app is built using the amazing [jMonkey engine](http://jmonkeyengine.org/). The jMonkey SDK is required to run the code in this repository. If you wish to run it, you'll need to create a new project in the jMonkey SDK, and copy the src/ and mobile/ folders into the projects base directory. You may also have to enable Android development in the projects properties.

This repository contains just the necessary source code files, and does not include the textures and models used in the app. As such it will not run unless alernate resources are made. I sourced many of the sounds and textures I used in the app from  the [Open Game Art](http://opengameart.org/) website.

jMonkey is distributed under the BSD license, which can be found [here](http://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/wiki/doku.php/bsd_license).
